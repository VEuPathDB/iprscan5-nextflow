Building
--------

Example build instructions - note that you will have to install the easel library to compile this

$> wget http://eddylab.org/software/hmmer3/3.1b2/hmmer-3.1b2.tar.gz
$> tar xf hmmer-3.1b2.tar.gz
$> cd hmmer-3.1b2
$> ./configure
$> make
$> make check

$> cd .../path/to/src/sfld/1
In the Makefile replace the path in EASEL_DIR with the 'easel' subdir of the hmmer
distribution (e.g. /path/to/hmmer-3.1b2/easel). Then run
$> make
